* The objective of the task is to make a 3d design CAD design of a **5 degree of freedom Robotic Arm** .

* Details:
	- You are required to create a **5 degree of freedom** Robotic arm with links and joints as specified in the image above.
	- The image is just an example to show the placement of each axis. You are free to choose the placement of actuators and joints and use any design you can think of...
	- The arm should have a robot workspace in the form of a semi circle with radius approx 40-60 cm.
	- You have to create the arm using **Tower Pro MG946R Metal Gear Servo** as actuatos. [Sample](https://grabcad.com/library/tower-pro-mg946r-metal-gear-servo-1) for a metal gear servo.
	- The model should have proper mounts and spaces for servos and other mechanical parts. You free to use any type mechanical components like screws, bearings etc.
	- All components in the arm should be connected with proper joints.

* You will be judged on the basis of the following criteria:
	- Manufacturability of the links and mounts (Preferebly 3d Printable)
	- Adhering to the giving details and guidelines.
	- Reusability and esay to modify in future if required.
	- You may use any methods and tools to achieve the task buy make sure to follow proper 3d modeling practices like constraints, joints etc.
