Hints
=====

-  The turtle needs to move in a inward or outward spiral motion with a
   certain increasing or decreasing radius. This radius should be
   sufficient to fit within the turtlesim window. But making it rotate
   in a circular manner, with only velocities to control is something to
   think about.

-  Use linear velocity as well as angular velocity with some combination
   to get this done.

-  Keep track of the number of circles completed so as to know when to
   stop. You can refer to Overview of rospy for more hint
