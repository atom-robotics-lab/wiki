# Hints

* The turtle needs to move in a inward or outward spiral motion with a certain increasing or decreasing radius. This radius should be
sufficient to fit within the turtlesim window. But making it rotate in a circular manner, with only
velocities to control is something to think about.

* Use linear velocity as well as angular velocity with some combination to get this done.

* Keep track of the number of circles completed so as to know when to stop. You can refer to Overview of
