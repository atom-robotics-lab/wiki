## ROS Noetic Installation

### Setup your sources.list

Setup your computer to accept software from packages.ros.org. 

```shell
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
```

### Setup your keys

```shell
    sudo apt install curl # if you haven't already installed curl
```
```shell
    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```

### Installation

* Update package repositories

```shell
sudo apt update
```

* Install ROS

```shell
sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop-full
```

## Configuration steps

1. Adding environment variables: To Automatically add ROS environment variables to your bash session every time a new shell (terminal) is launched, enter the following commands (this step is similar as adding environmental variable in windows):

```shell
echo "source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

2. Initialize rosdep: Before you can use many ROS tools, you will need to initialize rosdep. rosdep enables you to easily install system dependencies for source you want to compile and is required to run some core components in ROS.

```shell
sudo apt install python3-rosdep python3-rosinstall python3-rosinstall-generator python3-wstool build-essential
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
```
