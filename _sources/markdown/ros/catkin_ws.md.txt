# Create Workspace

* catkin is the oﬃcial build system of ROS and the successor to the original ROS build system, rosbuild.
* catkin combines CMake macros and Python scripts to provide some functionality on top of CMake's normal workﬂow.
* catkin was designed to be more conventional than rosbuild, allowing for better distribution of packages, better cross-compiling support, and better portability.

## src/

* The src folder contains the source code of catkin packages. This is where you can extract/checkout/clone source code for the packages you want to build.
* Each folder within the src folder contains one or more catkin packages. This folder should remain unchanged by conﬁguring, building, or installing.
* The root of the src folder contains a symbolic link to catkin's boiler-plate 'toplevel' directory. When we execute the catkin_make command from the workspace folder, it checks CMakeLists.txt ﬁle. This ﬁle is invoked by CMake during the conﬁguration of the catkin projects in the workspace. It can be created by calling catkin_init_workspace in the src folder inside the src folder and builds each package.

## build/

* The build folder is where CMake is invoked to build the catkin packages in the src folder. CMake and catkin keep their cache information and other intermediate ﬁles here.
* The build folder does not have to be contained within the workspace nor does it have to be outside of the src folder, but this is recommended

## devel/

* The development folder (or devel folder) is where built targets are placed before being installed.
* The way targets are organized in the devel folder is the same as their layout when they are installed
* This provides a useful testing and development environment which does not require invoking the installation step.
* The location of the devel folder is controlled by a catkin speciﬁc CMake variable called CATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX , and it defaults to build/devel folder.
* This is the default behavior because it might be confusing to CMake users if they invoked CMake in a build folder and that modiﬁed things outside of the current directory.

## Creating a catkin workspace

* Open up the terminal.

* Create the root workspace directory. You can name your directory anything but by ROS convention we will use catkin_ws as the name

```shell
cd ~/
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src/
cd catkin_ws
```

* Initialize the workspace

```shell
catkin init
```

* Build the workspace

```shell
cd  ~/catkin_ws
catkin build
```

* Now to make your installation deetectable in ROS 

```shell
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

By doing this , all the packages inside src/ will be visible to ROS 

* The setup.bash will need to be sourced everytime. To not do that , add this to your ~/.bashrc

```shell
nano ~/.bashrc
# Add to the end
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```
