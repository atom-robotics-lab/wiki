# Command: rosrun

rosrun allows you to run an executable in an arbitrary package from anywhere without having to give its full path or cd/roscd there ﬁrst.

Usage:

```shell
rosrun <package> <executable>
```

`<package>` is nothing but the package name which you have created using catkin_create_pkg command or used any other package.

`<executable>` is the python or cpp ﬁle.

## To create an executable python file

* After creating a package, create a folder in the package names as scripts folder to store all the python ﬁles in that folder.

```shell
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/<package>
mkdir scripts
```

* Here we can create python scripts by running this command by going into the scripts directory,

```shell
cd scripts
touch filename.py
```

* Now you can edit your python ﬁle and before running you have to make it executable by running
this command once,

```shell
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/<package>/scripts
chmod +x filename.py
```

* Here we can create cpp ﬁles by running this command by going into the src directory,

```shell
cd src
touch filename.cpp
```

Now you can edit your cpp ﬁle , but for making it executable we have to edit the CMakeLists.txt ﬁle

Add these few lines at the bottom of CMakeLists.txt ﬁle,

```m
add_executable(filename src/filename.cpp)
target_link_libraries(filename ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
```

Then run this command,

```shell
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin build
```
