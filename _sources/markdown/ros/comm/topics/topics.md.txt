# ROS Topics

* ROS Topics allow unidirectional communication between ROS Nodes.
* When using ROS Topics a ROS Node can be a publisher, subscriber or both.
* A ROS Node acting as a publisher can publish data on a ROS Topic and a subscriber ROS Node can subscribe to a ROS Topic.
* Publisher and Subscriber Nodes will exchange ROS Messages over a ROS Topic.
* A ROS Message is a simple data structure, comprising typed ﬁelds (integer, ﬂoating point, boolean, etc.). So a ROS Message can hold data of various data-types.

* Consider this analogy,
* Let's say you are subscribed to a newspaper called The Melodic published by a publishing house called OSRF.
* Every morning your paperboy Jon Doe will deliver this newspaper to you.
* `OSRF <--> ROS Publisher Node`
* OSRF which is publishing the newspaper as a Publisher Node.
* `You <--> ROS Subscriber Node`
* You along with your neighbours who are subscribed to this newspaper as Subscriber Nodes.
* `Jon Doe <--> ROS Topic`
* Your paperboy who is taking the newspaper from the publisher and delivering it to its subscribers as a ROS Topic
* `The Melodic Newspaper <--> ROS Message`
* The physical newspaper is your ROS Message.
* `Sports and Robotics Sections of The Melodic <--> Data Fields defined in ROS Message`
* The sections of the newspaper is the Data Fields deﬁned in the ROS Message.
