# rostopic command

* rostopic contains the rostopic command-line tool for displaying debug information about ROS Topics, including publishers, subscribers, publishing rate, and ROS Messages.

* Use

```shell
rostopic --h
```

for getting the rostopic command help.

* ## list

* rostopic list returns a list of all topics currently subscribed to and published.

* In one terminal run

```shell
roscore
```

* In the other one, run 

```shell
rostopic list
```

The above should give you a list of the default ROS topics

* For this tutorial, we will also use turtlesim. Please run in a new terminal:

```shell
rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
```
You will see a small blue box with probably a diﬀerent turtle within it.

* Now, check again the rostopic list command in another terminal and observe the topics being subscribed or published.

* ## type, info and rosmsg

## type

Communication on topics happens by sending ROS messages between nodes. To communicate, the
publisher and subscriber must send and receive the same type of message. This means that a topic
type is deﬁned by the message type published on it. The type of the message sent on a topic can be
determined using rostopic type .

```shell
rostopic type [topic_name]
```

From the previous section, we know that the turtlesim node has 3 topics being
published/subscribed.

* /turtle1/cmd_vel
* /turtle1/pose
* /turtle1/color_sensor

Lets consider the topics /turtle1/cmd_vel . Enter the following command to get the message type.

```shell
rostopic type /turtle1/cmd_vel
```

## rosmsg

* As you can observe the type of message associated with /turtle1/cmd_vel is geometry_msgs/Twist . let's look into more detail of te message, using

```shell
rosmsg show geometry_msgs/Twist
```

* A message consists of two parts, ﬁeld and constant. Simply, ﬁelds is the datatype and constants are the representative value From the above ﬁgure, you can observe that these ﬁeld and constants are displayed twice. However, both of these sections, are separate since they have a diﬀerent header or diﬀerent sub-information from the same robot. The 2 headers seen are...

* `geometry_msgs/Vector3 linear` : Describes the linear velocities of all the 3 axes.
* `geometry_msgs/Vector3 angular` : While this header describes, angular velocities of all 3 axes.

* ## info

* This command provides a little more detail about topics then type argument.

```shell
rostopic info /turtle1/cmd_vel
```

* The output of this command will yield both the message type and the nodes which are publishing it or subscribing it.

* ## pub

  * `rostopic pub` publishes data on to a topic currently advertised.
  * Usage
  
  ```shell
  rostopic pub [topic] [msg_type] [args]
  ```
  * Lets move the turtle inside the sim window

  ```shell
  rostopic pub /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist 
  "linear:
        x: 0.0
        y: 0.0
        z: 0.0
   angular:
        x: 0.0
        y: 0.0
        z: 0.0"

* Now that we have the complete blank (with all constants as zeros) pub command for /turtle1 /cmd_vel , let's rotate it about its z-axis (Yep! the Omega variable).

```shell
rostopic pub /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist "linear:
x: 0.0
y: 0.0
z: 0.0
angular:
x: 0.0
y: 0.0
z: 0.5
```

* After executing the above command you will see the turtle rotating clockwise.

* However, the turtle only rotated for a while and not continuously. This is because our pub command was only sent once. So, to keep the turtle rotating we need to keep sending our pub command repeatedly. And to do so, we'll use the -r argument with pub command.

* The following command is used to publish a steady stream of commands at a rate of 10Hz.

```shell
rostopic pub -r 10 /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist "linear:
x: 0.0
y: 0.0
z: 0.0
angular:
x: 0.0
y: 0.0
z: 0.5"
```
* You can always know more about pub command by simply typing rostopic pub --help .

* ## echo

* rostopic echo shows the data published on a topic.
* Usage

```shell
rostopic echo [topic]
```

* In the earlier section, at the end, we used -r argument to keep it rotation at an angular velocity of 0.5 units. But what if the velocity is unknown and we need this information as feedback to control the motion of turtle???
* Our desire here is to get the pose information or simply one or all of the turtle's x,y, and z values w.r.t to the world.
* But let's see if there is any data being published by the turtlesim node in the ﬁrst place. To do so, we'll use the following  command...

```shell
rostopic list -p
```

* From the -p we know 2 topic is being published

```shell
/turtle1/color_sensor
/turtle1/pose
```

* Let's see more into the /turtle1/pose topic.
* Luckily the pose information of turtle from the turtlesim is being published on the topic /turtle1/pose

* To display the pose data, enter the following command...

```shell
rostopic echo /turtle1/pose
```
