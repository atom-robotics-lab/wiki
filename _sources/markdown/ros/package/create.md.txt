# Create a ROS package

This tutorial will demonstrate how to use the catkin_create_pkg script to create a new catkin
package, and what you can do with it after it has been created.

1. First, navigate to the source space directory of the catkin workspace you've created.

```shell
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
```

2. Now, use the catkin_create_pkg script to create a new package called pkg_ros_basics which depends on std_msgs, roscpp, and rospy: 

```shell
catkin_create_pkg pkg_ros_basics std_msgs rospy roscpp
```

* This will create a beginner_tutorials folder which contains a package.xml and a CMakeLists.txt , which have been partially ﬁlled out with the information you gave catkin_create_pkg .

* catkin_create_pkg requires that you give it a package_name and optionally a list of dependencies on which that package depends: catkin_create_pkg <package_name> [depend1] [depend2] [depend3]

3. Now, you need to build the packages in the catkin workspace

```shell
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin build
```

* Inside the package, there are src folder, package.xml , CMakeLists.txt , and the include folders.

  * CMakeLists.txt: This ﬁle has all the commands to build the ROS source code inside the package and create the executable. For more information about CMakeLists visit here. package.xml: This is an XML ﬁle. It mainly contains the package dependencies information, and so forth. 
  * src: The source code of ROS packages are kept in this folder.
  * package.xml : This file mainly contains the package dependencies ,information etc.
