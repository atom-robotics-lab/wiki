Creating a package
==================

**Goal:** Create a new package using CMake , and run its executable.

Background
----------

1 What is a ROS 2 package?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A package is an organizational unit for your ROS 2 code.
If you want to be able to install your code or share it with others, then you'll need it organized in a package.
With packages, you can release your ROS 2 work and allow others to build and use it easily.

Package creation in ROS 2 uses ament as its build system and colcon as its build tool.
You can create a package using either CMake or Python, which are officially supported, though other build types do exist.

2 What makes up a ROS 2 package?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ROS 2 CMake packages each have their own minimum required contents:

.. note::

   * CMakeLists.txt file that describes how to build the code within the package
   * include/<package_name> directory containing the public headers for the package
   * package.xml file containing meta information about the package
   * src directory containing the source code for the package


The simplest possible package may have a file structure that looks like:



.. code-block:: console

   my_package/
         CMakeLists.txt
         include/my_package/
         package.xml
         src/



3 Packages in a workspace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A single workspace can contain as many packages as you want, each in their own folder.
You can also have packages of different build types in one workspace (CMake, Python, etc.).
You cannot have nested packages.

Best practice is to have a ``src`` folder within your workspace, and to create your packages in there.
This keeps the top level of the workspace “clean”.

A trivial workspace might look like:

.. code-block:: console

  workspace_folder/
      src/
        cpp_package_1/
            CMakeLists.txt
            include/cpp_package_1/
            package.xml
            src/

        py_package_1/
            package.xml
            resource/py_package_1
            setup.cfg
            setup.py
            py_package_1/
        ...
        cpp_package_n/
            CMakeLists.txt
            include/cpp_package_n/
            package.xml
            src/


Prerequisites
-------------

You should have a ROS 2 workspace after following the instructions in the :doc:`previous tutorial <./../colcon_ws>`.
You will create your package in this workspace.


Tasks
-----

1 Create a package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Let's use the workspace you created in the :ref:`previous tutorial <new-directory>`, ``ros2_ws``, for your new package.

Make sure you are in the ``src`` folder before running the package creation command.


.. code-block:: console

   cd ~/ros2_ws/src

 

The command syntax for creating a new package in ROS 2 is:


.. code-block:: console

   ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake --license Apache-2.0 <package_name>



For this tutorial, you will use the optional argument ``--node-name`` which creates a simple Hello World type executable in the package.

Enter the following command in your terminal:


.. code-block:: console

   ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake --license Apache-2.0 --node-name my_node my_package


You will now have a new folder within your workspace's ``src`` directory called ``my_package``.

After running the command, your terminal will return the message:


.. code-block:: console

   going to create a new package
   package name: my_package
   destination directory: /home/user/ros2_ws/src
   package format: 3
   version: 0.0.0
   description: TODO: Package description
   maintainer: ['<name> <email>']
   licenses: ['TODO: License declaration']
   build type: ament_cmake
   dependencies: []
   node_name: my_node
   creating folder ./my_package
   creating ./my_package/package.xml
   creating source and include folder
   creating folder ./my_package/src
   creating folder ./my_package/include/my_package
   creating ./my_package/CMakeLists.txt
   creating ./my_package/src/my_node.cpp

   
You can see the automatically generated files for the new package.

2 Build a package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Putting packages in a workspace is especially valuable because you can build many packages at once by running ``colcon build`` in the workspace root.
Otherwise, you would have to build each package individually.

Return to the root of your workspace:

.. code-block:: console

   cd ~/ros2_ws

   

Now you can build your packages:

.. code-block:: console

   colcon build

  

Recall from the last tutorial that you also have the ``ros_tutorials`` packages in your ``ros2_ws``.
You might have noticed that running ``colcon build`` also built the ``turtlesim`` package.
That's fine when you only have a few packages in your workspace, but when there are many packages, ``colcon build`` can take a long time.

To build only the ``my_package`` package next time, you can run:

.. code-block:: console

    colcon build --packages-select my_package

3 Source the setup file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To use your new package and executable, first open a new terminal and source your main ROS 2 installation.

Then, from inside the ``ros2_ws`` directory, run the following command to source your workspace:



.. code-block:: console

   source install/setup.bash



Now that your workspace has been added to your path, you will be able to use your new package's executables.

4 Use the package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run the executable you created using the ``--node-name`` argument during package creation, enter the command:

.. code-block:: console

  ros2 run my_package my_node

Which will return a message to your terminal:


.. code-block:: console

   hello world my_package package


5 Examine package contents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Inside ``ros2_ws/src/my_package``, you will see the files and folders that ``ros2 pkg create`` automatically generated:


.. code-block:: console

   CMakeLists.txt  include  package.xml  src

``my_node.cpp`` is inside the ``src`` directory.
This is where all your custom C++ nodes will go in the future.


6 Customize package.xml
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may have noticed in the return message after creating your package that the fields ``description`` and ``license`` contain ``TODO`` notes.
That's because the package description and license declaration are not automatically set, but are required if you ever want to release your package.
The ``maintainer`` field may also need to be filled in.

From ``ros2_ws/src/my_package``, open ``package.xml`` using your preferred text editor:


.. code-block:: xml

   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <?xml-model
      href="http://download.ros.org/schema/package_format3.xsd"
      schematypens="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"?>
   <package format="3">
   <name>my_package</name>
   <version>0.0.0</version>
   <description>TODO: Package description</description>
   <maintainer email="user@todo.todo">user</maintainer>
   <license>TODO: License declaration</license>

   <buildtool_depend>ament_cmake</buildtool_depend>

   <test_depend>ament_lint_auto</test_depend>
   <test_depend>ament_lint_common</test_depend>

   <export>
      <build_type>ament_cmake</build_type>
   </export>
   </package>

Input your name and email on the ``maintainer`` line if it hasn't been automatically populated for you.
Then, edit the ``description`` line to summarize the package:

.. code-block:: xml

  <description>Beginner client libraries tutorials practice package</description>

Then, update the ``license`` line.
You can read more about open source licenses `here <https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical>`__.
Since this package is only for practice, it's safe to use any license.
We'll use ``Apache License 2.0``:

.. code-block:: xml

  <license>Apache License 2.0</license>

Don't forget to save once you're done editing.

Below the license tag, you will see some tag names ending with ``_depend``.
This is where your ``package.xml`` would list its dependencies on other packages, for colcon to search for.
``my_package`` is simple and doesn't have any dependencies, but you will see this space being utilized in upcoming tutorials.




Summary
-------

You've created a package to organize your code and make it easy to use for others.

Your package was automatically populated with the necessary files, and then you used colcon to build it so you can use its executables in your local environment.
