# ROS Package

Software in ROS is organized in packages. A package might contain ROS nodes, a ROS-
independent library, a dataset, conﬁguration ﬁles, a third-party piece of software, or
anything else that logically constitutes a useful module. The goal of these packages it to
provide this useful functionality in an easy-to-consume manner so that software can be
easily reused. In general, ROS packages follow a "Goldilocks" principle: enough
functionality to be useful, but not too much that the package is heavyweight and diﬃcult
to use from other software.
