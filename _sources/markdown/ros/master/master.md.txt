# ROS Master

* As you know ROS Nodes are building blocks of any ROS Application. A single ROS Application may have multiple ROS Nodes which communicate with each other.
* The role of the ROS Master is to enable individual ROS nodes to locate one another.
* Once these nodes have located each other they communicate with each other peer-to-peer.
* The ROS Master provides naming and registration services to the rest of the nodes in the ROS system.
* You can say, communication is established between nodes by the ROS Master. So, without ROS Master running ROS Nodes can not communicate with each other.

# Start the ROS Master 

To start the ROS Master just enter in the terminal

```shell
roscore
```

The above command will start three things

So roscore will start the following:

1. ROS Master
2. ROS Parameter Server
3. rosout Logging Node
