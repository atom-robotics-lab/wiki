CAD Selection Task
===================

Greetings to all the passionate CAD designers out there. Do you think you got what it takes to get the job done ? 
Then here is the task specially curated to test your skills and thought process to put your skills to the test.

The TASK provided here is for those people who have specialized in the field of CAD designing 
and are interested in joining **A.T.O.M** society. Those who successfully finish the 
task within the given time frame will be given a chance to give an interview to become a
member of the **A.T.O.M** society.


-  The tasks are not only to test your problem solving skills but also
   to see your diligence to learn new stuff the ablity to get the work
   done.

-  If there are any 3D Designs or any other previous works (even 2d
   sketches are fine) related to the stuff you have worked on, you are
   welcome to share those as well with your submissions. It is optional,
   but this would help us further see your creativity and skills.


.. Note::
    To achieve the above task, you are free to use any software that you are familiar with but you are recommended to use **Fusion360** as you will have to switch over to fusion360 if you join the society.


Problem statement
------------------

- The objective of this task is to design a 4 wheel differential drive robot
- The robot should be powered only with 2 motors i.e. all 4 wheels should receive power from 2 motors while maximum number of motors that can be used are 2.
- Size of robot should not exceed 30x30x20 (length, breadth , height in cm) 
- All the refence cad models like battery , motors and wheels are provided below and only those parts are required to be used.
- All the other parts can be used by the person at its own will but should be mounted correctly on the robot with proper brackets and mounts.

.. Warning::
    The last date to submit the task is **11 December, 2022**.

Resource Models

- **Motors**: https://grabcad.com/library/jonson-geared-motor-1
- **Battery**: https://grabcad.com/library/turnigy-2200mah-3s-20c-lipo-pack-1
- **Wheel**: https://grabcad.com/library/robot-wheel-70x20mm-1 

You may use bigger wheels if you like.

Things to keep in mind
-----------------------

While designing the Robot there are some things that you should keep in mind.

- The model should have proper mounts and spaces for motors and other mechanical parts. You free to use any type mechanical components like screws, bearings etc.

- All components in the robot should be connected with proper joints.

- You will be judged on the basis of the following criteria:
    - Manufacturability of the links and mounts (Preferebly 3d Printable)
    - Adhering to the giving details and guidelines.
    - Reusability and easy to modify in future if required.
    - You may use any methods and tools to achieve the task but make sure to follow proper 3d modeling practices like constraints, joints etc.

- **For Additional Points**: The robot you will be designing is for a **robo race challange** in which the robot is supposed to drive through rough terrains. Keeping that in mind the robot should also have the following features:
    - The robot should be as small as possible.
    - Robot should be able to drive though rough and uneven terrains
    - The components should should be placed in such a way that the robot could also be drived in a upside down manner.


.. Note:: To achieve the above task, you are free to use any software that you are familiar with but you are recommended to use **Fusion360** as you will have to switch over to fusion360 if you join the society.
