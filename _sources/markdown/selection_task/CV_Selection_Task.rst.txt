Computer Vision Selection Task
========================================

Hi there, Welcome to the specialized selection task for all of you Computer Vision nerds.

The TASK provided here is for those people who have specialized in the field of Computer 
Vision and are interested in joining **A.T.O.M** society. Those who successfully finish the 
task within the given time frame will be given a chance to give an interview to become a
member of the **A.T.O.M** society.

This task will put your computer vision and problem solving skills to the test.

.. Warning::
   The *Deadline* for completing the task: *11th December, 2022* Head to the
   :ref: `Problem statement section <Problem statement>` to begin with the task.

-  The objective of the task is to count the number of small, medium and large pipes from the
   given video footage.

-  The given footage is taken from a camera mounted on top of a mobile base. The mobile base is 
   travelling across a warehouse inside a simulation world. There are several pipes of various 
   sizes(small, medium and large) kept inside the warehouse. 

-  There will be a penalty for each uncounted pipe.

-  This task is based on a **real-world application** of computer vision in robotics, where robots are 
   used in environments like warehouses for surveillience and management of goods.

-  To achieve this task, you are supposed to devise a method to count the pipes belonging to various
   sizes.

.. Note:: You are free to use any resource available online.

Hints
-----

-  Take a look at the shape of the pipes. Is there a method to detect all the circles in a 
   given frame ?
   
-  How can you differentiate between pipes of different sizes?
