Intro To ROS 2
============


**What is ROS2 ?**

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is the next generation of the Robot Operating System (ROS), designed to be more flexible, scalable, and reliable for modern robotic systems. It provides a framework for developing robot software by offering tools, libraries, and conventions to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot applications.
Since ROS was started in 2007, a lot has changed in the robotics and ROS community. The goal of the ROS 2 project is to adapt to these changes, leveraging what is great about ROS 1 and improving what isnâ€™t.

.. note:: For more info on ROS2 please visit the \ `Official ROS2 Website <https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html#>`__. It has got really interesting videos and resources about the functioning and projects based on ROS2. To get started with learning ROS2 head over to `ROS2 Tutorials <https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials.html>`__
