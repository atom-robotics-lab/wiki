Electronics Selection Task 2024-2025
====================================
This year, we've introduced a three-tiered Electronic Selection Task. Here's a brief summary:


Challenge Levels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The electronic selection task is divided into three levels, labeled from Level 0 to Level 2. 
Each level presents its distinct set of challenges. 
Whether you're a novice or an experienced enthusiast, there's something here for everyone.

Scoring System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To add an extra layer of excitement, each task within these levels carries a specific point value mentioned alongside 
the problem statement. Your performance will determine your score, and points will be awarded accordingly.

Qualification Criteria
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To progress to the next stage, which is the interview phase, you must accumulate a minimum of 7 points in total. These 
points will be awarded after evaluating your submissions. Therefore, ensure you put your best foot forward for a chance to advance!




Level 0 - Getting Started
--------------------------

Level 0 serves as the foundation and includes tasks such as:

1. Blink an RGB light using three different buttons, where each button controls a specific color of the light.
2. The challenge is to ensure that pressing each button makes the corresponding color blink while the other colors remain unaffected.
                                                                               





Level 1 - Advanced Challenges
-----------------------------
Level 1 elevates the complexity with more intricate problems and higher point allocations. Stay tuned for the list of tasks!

Task Description:

   1. Servo Motor Control: Rotate a servo motor based on the input from a potentiometer. The servo should move proportionally to the potentiometer's position.
   2. Angle Display: Print the current angle of the servo motor on an OLED screen. Ensure that the displayed angle accurately reflects the servo's position.

Level 2 - Expert Territory
--------------------------
The ultimate challenge! Level 2 will test even the most seasoned electronic enthusiasts. Prepare for some mind-bending tasks and 
substantial point rewards.

Task Description
----------------
PCB Designing - Create a schematic, perform routing, and submit a Gerber file. Additionally, provide screenshots of the 
schematics and a text file explaining your approach and detailing the schematic.                                    10 pts


Problem Statement
-----------------
Create a basic PCB capable of accepting battery input and producing different output voltages - 5V and 12V. Determine the 
track size to handle output currents of up to 2 Amps accordingly.

submissions
+++++++++++
You can submit the video of the task by performing it on hardware, along with the code. If, in case, you don't have the hardware, 
you can use online simulators like TinkerCad and screen record your task, then submit it. In addition to judging the output of 
the task, we will also consider the effort you have put into performing this task. Even if you are not able to complete the task, 
you may still submit it. Points will be allocated accordingly.
