   sizes(small, medium and large) kept inside the warehouse.

-  There will be a penalty for each uncounted pipe.

-  This task is based on a real-world application of computer vision in robotics, where robots are 
   used in environments like warehouses for surveillience and management of goods.

-  To achieve this task, you are supposed to devise a method to count the pipes belonging to various
   sizes.

.. Note:: You free to use any resource available online.
