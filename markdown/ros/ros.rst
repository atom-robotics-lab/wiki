Intro To ROS
============


**What is ROS ?**

ROS is an open-source, meta-operating system for your robot. It provides
the services you would expect from an operating system, including
hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of
commonly-used functionality, message-passing between processes, and
package management.

.. note:: For more info on ROS please visit the \ `Official ROS Website <https://www.ros.org>`__. It has got really interesting videos and resources about the functioning and projects based on ROS.
