Electronics Selection Task 2023-2024
============================
This year, we've introduced a three-tiered Electronic Selection Task. Here's a brief summary:


Challenge Levels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The electronic selection task is divided into three levels, labeled from Level 0 to Level 2. 
Each level presents its distinct set of challenges. 
Whether you're a novice or an experienced enthusiast, there's something here for everyone.

Scoring System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To add an extra layer of excitement, each task within these levels carries a specific point value mentioned alongside 
the problem statement. Your performance will determine your score, and points will be awarded accordingly.

Qualification Criteria
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To progress to the next stage, which is the interview phase, you must accumulate a minimum of 7 points in total. These 
points will be awarded after evaluating your submissions. Therefore, ensure you put your best foot forward for a chance to advance!




Level 0 - Getting Started
-------------------------

Level 0 serves as the foundation and includes tasks such as:

1. Blinking an LED with Arduino                                                                             1 point
2. Scrolling text on an OLED display                                                                        1 point
3. Playing a tune on a buzzer                                                                               1 point
4. Adjusting LED intensity using a potentiometer                                                            1 point
5. Controlling a servo motor                                                                                1 point


.. Note:: You will earn 1 point for each successfully completed task in Level 0. It's the ideal starting point for 
   those new to the world of electronics!


Level 1 - Advanced Challenges
------------------------------

Level 1 elevates the complexity with more intricate problems and higher point allocations. Stay tuned for the list of tasks!

Task Description:

Level 2 - Expert Territory
--------------------------
The ultimate challenge! Level 2 will test even the most seasoned electronic enthusiasts. Prepare for some mind-bending tasks and 
substantial point rewards.

Task Description
----------------
PCB Designing - Create a schematic, perform routing, and submit a Gerber file. Additionally, provide screenshots of the 
schematics and a text file explaining your approach and detailing the schematic.                                    10 pts


Problem Statement
-----------------
Create a basic PCB capable of accepting battery input and producing different output voltages - 5V and 12V. Determine the 
track size to handle output currents of up to 2 Amps accordingly.

   The **Deadline** for completing the task: **16th October, 2023**

submissions
+++++++++++
You can submit the video of the task by performing it on hardware, along with the code. If, in case, you don't have the hardware, 
you can use online simulators like TinkerCad and screen record your task, then submit it. In addition to judging the output of 
the task, we will also consider the effort you have put into performing this task. Even if you are not able to complete the task, 
you may still submit it. Points will be allocated accordingly.
