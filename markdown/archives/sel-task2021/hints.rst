Hints
=====

-  The turtle needs to move in a circular motion with a certain radius.
   This radius should be sufficient to fit within the turtlesim window.
   But making it rotate in a circular manner, with only velocities to
   control is something to think about.

-  Use linear velocity as well as angular velocity with some combination
   to get this done.

-  Keep tracking the distance travelled so as to know when to stop. You
   can refer to Overview of rospy for more hint
