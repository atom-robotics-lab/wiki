CAD Selection Task: Standard Instructions
=========================================


The TASK provided here is the selection criteria for joining the
**A.T.O.M** society. Those who sucessfully finish the task within the
given time frame will be eligible to give an interview and eventually
become a member of the **A.T.O.M** society.

-  The tasks are not only to test your problem solving skills but also
   to see your diligence to learn new stuff the ablity to get the work
   done.

-  You will be required to finish **Two** tasks in the alloted time
   frame. Both of them are supposed to be done in any 3d modeling
   software preferably **Fusion360**.

-  If there are any 3D Designs or any other previous works (even 2d
   sketches are fine) related to the stuff you have worked on, you are
   welcome to share those as well with your submissions. It is optional,
   but this would help us further see your creativity and skills.


---------------------------------------------

Level 1
======

-  The objective of the task is to make a 3D model of a part using the
   given engineering drawing.

-  To achieve this task you may use any method but the end result should
   be as close as possible to the original drawing.

-  You will be judged on the basis of your way of designing, so keep
   that in mind and make sure to follow proper practices(Like using
   constraints appropriately).

.. Note:: You may use any software that you are familiar with but you
   are recommended to use **Fusion360**.

Once you are done with the Task 1 please submit it by heading over to
`Submissions <https://atom-robotics-lab.github.io/wiki/markdown/archives/sel-task_cad_2022/cad_sel.html#submission-instructions>`__

.. Note:: Head to `Task 2 <https://atom-robotics-lab.github.io/wiki/markdown/archives/sel-task_cad_24/cad_sel.html#level2>`__ once you are done with
   task1.

Problem statement
=================


-  The objective of the task is to create or draw an eg/cad drawing for the following displayed below.

-  To acheive this task you are supposed to create a project in autocad and and make the desired output.



   Dont worry if you are new to CAD or Linux(Ubuntu), the task
   is fairly simple and we have provided you with ample resource and
   tutorials in this WIKI to the complete this task so only a strong
   will and a little bit of brains is required to get the work done.

LEVEL 2
=======

Problem statement
=================


-  The objective of the task is to create or draw an eg/cad drawing for the following displayed below.

-  To acheive this task you are supposed to create a project in autocad and and make the desired output.

Description
===========
- The slider-crank mechanism is indeed a fundamental mechanical linkage used in various machines and mechanisms. It consists of four main components: a crank, a slider, a connecting rod, and a pivot joint. 

 - Dont worry if you are new to CAD or Linux(Ubuntu), the task
   is fairly simple and we have provided you with ample resource and
   tutorials in this WIKI to the complete this task so only a strong
   will and a little bit of brains is required to get the work done.

Task 2
------

-  Video

   -  Once you are done with the modelling, you have to record a video
      of your screen where show the model from different angles, move
      all the joints and show itâ€™s working in the software you used.
      Then you have to upload the video on YouTube as unlisted and share
      a link to the video in the submission form.

-  Model file

   -  Once your Model is complete, upload the model files in a google
      drive folder and share the link in the google form below. Make
      sure to give viewing acess while creating the shareable link for
      the google drive.

Interview
---------

::

   - Once we review your submission, we will be calling you for a personal interview based on your work.
   - We would be asking about some general question related to computers and your thought process & stuff related to the task that you have performed.


.. Note:: Make sure you submit both of your task before the 27th of
   August. Both the submissions have to be done separately. Even if you
   are not able to complete entire the task you are requested to make
   the submission of the work that you have done anyway.
